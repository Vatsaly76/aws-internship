# üîê IAM (Identity and Access Management)

## üìò What is IAM?

**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is a foundational AWS service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can:
- Create and manage **users**, **groups**, and **roles**
- Define **permissions** to allow or deny access to specific AWS services
- Enforce **best security practices** such as least privilege and multi-factor authentication

IAM enables centralized access control in your AWS account, making it easy to give limited or full access to developers, admins, applications, or third parties ‚Äî all while ensuring your AWS environment remains secure.
